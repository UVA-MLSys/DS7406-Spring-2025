For Lab 2, you will need to run a simple CNN with PyTorch using the MNIST dataset on Rivanna. Then,
a. you will need to compare the execution time of each epoch on TensorFlow and PyTorch, as well as the total time used for the entire experiment.
b. Furthermore, you will then need to perform Part a. on different GPUs(e.g. A100, V100), and record the execution time under different settings.
c. Please provide possible strategies/comments to speed up the experiments, or to decrease the execution cost.
d. Submit your answers to the #labs channel on Slack.

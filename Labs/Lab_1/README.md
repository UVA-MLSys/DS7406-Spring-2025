For Lab 1, you will need to run a simple CNN with TensorFlow2 using the MNIST dataset on Riavanna. We will start with uploading files to Rivanna, then step into running script/notebook on it. Increase the epoch by 10 from 10 to 50 epochs.

Submissions:

1. Record the train, validation and test loss for each epoch [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] 
2. Plot the train, validation loss history for 50 epochs.
3. Plot the train, validation and test loss and accuracy for those different epochs [10, 20, 30, 40, 50].
4. Write a 1-2 page report on your insights and with these two plots. Submit that report file and your code/notebook.
